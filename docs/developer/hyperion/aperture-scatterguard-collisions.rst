Aperture Scatterguard Collisions
==================================

If the aperture/scatterguard are not moved sensibly in y it is possible for the scatterguard to collide with the cryostream. See the below diagram...

If for example the top aperture is to be chosen then the whole assembly must move down so that the top aperture matches the beam then the scatterguard up to match the top aperture. If instead the bottom aperture is chosen then the scatterguard must move down then the whole assembly moved up.
